Puppetstein

--------------------------------------------
What does it do?
  - Allows easy composing of puppet-agent with arbitrary versions of its components
  - Also includes options for auto-testing puppet-agent builds using vmpooler VMs (and also vagrant probably)
    puppetstein 1.5.4 --install --vmpooler --keyfile=~/.ssh/id_rsa-acceptance
    puppetstein SHA --install --vmpooler --tests=/path/to/tests

  - Option for PR testing puppet components
    --facter_pr=271

  - Fetch puppet-agent builds by version
  - Replace component bits with local changes
    --facter=~/Coding/facter
--------------------------------------------

1) Install existing PA version onto a vmpooler VM
   - Run a selected set of tests on the install

2) Compose a puppet-agent using specified versions of component
  - Requires base PA version and knowledge of all component versions in it.
    Going to need to replace a component with the specified thing.
    Maybe branch=master is the base and then replace stuff in components.json?
    No, just specify a vesion of PA and we'll just modify project.json with the request
